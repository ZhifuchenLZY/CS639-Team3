**(1) Login/Sign Up:** Create an account and login with user's email and password. Use Firebase Authentication for user authentication.

**(2) Log meals**: Users can log their breakfast, lunch and dinner by inputing food name and weight, and our app will query an API to determine the calories and nutrition of these food. In addition, user can switch the date to look up log history, which is default showing today.

**(3) Analyze**: The nutrition from all the food the user consumes, including proteins, fats, and carbohydrates, will be tracked and displayed in the form of a pie chart. Additionally, the application will compare the actual intake of nutrients with the ideal intake in a table and show the changes in today's nutrient intake compared to yesterday. 

**(3) Recommend**: The application will recommend appropriate meals based on the user's nutritional intake by calling a web API. For example, if the user's protein intake is generally insufficient, the application will recommend protein-rich foods; if the user's fat intake exceeds the recommended level, the application will suggest low-fat foods, and so on.
